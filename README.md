# CliThings

Little machines. [o.o]

This repo contains a selection of little machines.

They are digital, not physical, but true "contraptions" none the less,built from parts, strung together, to do something interesting.

Machines sometimes break, but I try to craft them well. The elixir ecosystem should be stable enough, I hope, for them to not become obsolete.

And a constraint - To help my creativity: No unit tests. These are true "contraptions". If you need tests to understand them, then you need to restructure them.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `cli_things` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do

  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/cli_things>.
