Little machines. [o.o]

This repo contains a selection of little machines.

They are digital, not physical, but true "contraptions" none the less, built from parts, strung together with wild abandon (like the old game, "The Incredible Machine", only here the 'parts' are bits of code).

Machines sometimes break, but I try to craft them well. The elixir ecosystem should be stable enough, I hope, for them to not become obsolete.

And a constraint - To help my creativity: No unit tests. These are true "contraptions". If you need tests to understand them, then you need to restructure them.

## Running

This will be packaged using EScript eventually, but for now, run with: `mix run -e "CliThings.hello"`
