## Wacky ideas

Why I like this "layers" experiment.

Layers might help us to grow the program, somewhat organically, over a long period of time. That in itself is cool enough, a different way of building a program.

This might result in something quite useful. We let the layers build up over an extended amount of time, have lots of them, no limit. 
If we don't limit creativity like we usually do (by formally defining 4-to-5 layers and sticking to them), what would the result be?
- eg. 1 year into the future - What would the 'interface' look like if it were built on layers that were consistently added over time? Would we have 20 layers by then? 
- What about 5 years into the future? Would this still be terminal-based, or something more graphical?
